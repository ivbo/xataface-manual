== Sorting Filter Results

[discrete]
=== Problem

Filter lists are sorted by the "filtered" field in alphabetical order.  You want to sort the filter lists on some other column.

[discrete]
=== Solution

Use the `filter.sort.` fields.ini directive to specify the field that the filter should sort on.

E.g.

.Sort the "city" filter in descending order
[source,ini]
----
[city]
  filter=1
  filter.sort="city desc"  
----

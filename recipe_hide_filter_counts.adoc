== Hiding Filter Counts

[discrete]
=== Problem

You want to hide the counts for each entry in the "filters" drop-down list on the list view.  By default when you add a filter list via the `filter` directive, each row has the "count" displayed beside it:

.A result filter list.  Notice each row has a (1) beside it indicating that there is 1 row matching that filter.

We want to hide this.

=== Solution

Use the `show_filter_counts` preferences directive to hide these counts as follows.  In the `_prefs` section of the `conf.ini` file, add:

[source,ini]
----
show_filter_counts=0
----

After this change, the filter lists will look like:
